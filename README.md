> Developed and trained entirely on a MacBook M4 Max (64GB RAM, MPS acceleration). The full pipeline -- from LLM data correction (97K domains) through embedding generation and model training -- completes in under 5 hours. The LLM labeling runs asynchronously via AWS Bedrock while all model training (TF-IDF, MLP distillation, ModernBERT fine-tuning) fits within Apple Silicon's memory budget. The compute constraint mirrors production economics: the best model turns out to be the simplest one.

## What This Project Is

Production URL classification in adtech has historically relied on sparse NLP pipelines -- TF-IDF over crawled page text, trained on hand-labeled taxonomies. That architecture shipped in 2018 and still powers real-time bidding decisions at scale. **This project asks: what changes when you replace the human annotation pipeline with frontier LLMs, and can modern dense representations (transformer encoders, knowledge distillation from billion-parameter teachers) outperform classical sparse methods when the upstream feature generation itself comes from an LLM?**

The answer is architecturally significant for anyone deploying LLM-augmented ML systems: **the representation bottleneck shifts from feature extraction to feature encoding**, and dense models can actually degrade discriminative signal that LLMs embed directly into generated text.

We implement a complete **LLM-as-data-engine pipeline** on the [Kaggle Website IAB Categorization](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bpmtips/websiteiabcategorization) dataset (98K domains, 27 IAB Tier-1 categories) -- programmatic label synthesis, soft-label knowledge distillation, sentence-transformer embedding generation, and multi-architecture downstream training. The pipeline discovers that **49.7% of crowd-sourced annotations are incorrect**, corrects them via LLM consensus, and then benchmarks four fundamentally different model architectures on the cleaned signal:

1. **TF-IDF + LinearSVC** -- sparse high-dimensional projection (30K features) with max-margin classification on LLM-generated keyword vocabularies
2. **MLP + KL Distillation** -- dense 384-dim E5-small-v2 embeddings distilled from Opus soft probability distributions via temperature-scaled KL divergence (T=2.0, alpha=0.7)
3. **ModernBERT Fine-tuning** -- end-to-end 150M-parameter encoder adaptation with discriminative pre-training on corrected supervision
4. **Linear baselines** (Logistic Regression, SGD) -- convex optimization on identical TF-IDF features to isolate the contribution of non-linear decision boundaries

## The Core Insight: LLM-Generated Features Invert the Representation Hierarchy

The counterintuitive result: the sparsest model dominates. TF-IDF + LinearSVC (91.6% top-1) beats the distilled MLP (84.9%) by 6.7 percentage points and achieves 50x lower inference latency (0.02ms vs 1ms per domain).

The mechanism is information-theoretic. When an LLM generates keywords like "online store, electronics, gadgets" for an e-commerce domain, those tokens are **already category-aligned features** -- they carry near-maximal mutual information with the target label. TF-IDF with sublinear term frequency and inverse document frequency weighting preserves this discriminative structure: "automotive" receives high IDF weight and maps almost bijectively to "Autos & Vehicles." The LinearSVC's max-margin hyperplane in this 30K-dimensional space (99.9% sparsity, ~70 non-zero features per document) exploits the near-linear separability that the LLM created.

Dense encoders (E5-small-v2, 384-dim) perform a lossy dimensionality reduction that **destroys the lexical precision the LLM encoded**. In the dense embedding space, "automotive" and "car dealership" and "vehicle financing" collapse into a neighborhood -- useful for semantic similarity retrieval, but harmful when the original tokens already carried category-discriminative signal. The MLP must then recover from a representation that traded classification-relevant variance for semantic smoothness.

This is not a general indictment of dense representations. It is a specific architectural finding: **when the upstream data generation is itself a classification act (LLM keyword extraction conditioned on category priors), sparse bag-of-words models are the information-theoretically optimal downstream consumer.** The traditional representation learning value proposition -- learning features from raw data -- is inverted when the features arrive pre-learned.

## The Two-LLM Architecture: Decomposed Annotation Pipeline

A factored approach that separates deterministic classification (hard labels, keyword extraction) from probabilistic calibration (soft distributional targets). Each LLM operates at a different cost-quality tradeoff point, with the cheaper model handling exhaustive coverage and the expensive model providing rich distillation signal on a stratified subset:

### Data Flow for a Single Domain

```
"espn.com" (Kaggle label: "Arts & Entertainment" -- WRONG)
     |
     |--- Sonnet 4 corrects   --> tier1 = "Sports"
     |                            keywords = "football, NBA, MLB, scores, highlights"
     |
     |--- Opus 4.6 produces   --> {Sports: 0.95, Entertainment: 0.15, Games: 0.08, ...}
     |
     |--- TF-IDF vectorizes   --> sparse 30K-dim vector (keywords become features)
     |--- E5-small encodes    --> dense 384-dim embedding
     |
     |--- LinearSVC classifies from TF-IDF --> "Sports" (0.02ms)
     |--- MLP classifies from embedding    --> "Sports" (1ms with cached embedding)
     |--- ModernBERT classifies end-to-end --> "Sports" (10ms)
```

## Results

### Model Comparison (all evaluated on the same corrected validation set: 9,810 domains)

| Model | Val Top-1 | Val Top-3 | Test Top-1 | Macro-F1 | Params | Inference |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **TF-IDF + LinearSVC** | **91.6%** | **99.3%** | **91.7%** | **0.880** | ~30K features | 0.02 ms |
| TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | 90.4% | 99.4% | -- | 0.878 | ~30K features | 0.02 ms |
| MLP (E5 + KL distillation) | 84.9% | 98.3% | -- | 0.814 | 337K | ~1 ms |
| ModernBERT (corrected labels) | (in progress) | -- | -- | -- | 150M | ~10 ms |

### v1 Baseline (noisy Kaggle labels, for comparison)

| Model | Val Top-1 | Val Top-3 | Params |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| v1 ModernBERT | 61.3% | 80.0% | 150M |
| v1 MLP (distilled) | 45.1% | 68.0% | 135K |
| Random baseline | 3.7% | 11.1% | -- |

### The Impact of Label Correction (v1 to v2): Supervision Quality vs Model Capacity

| Factor | v1 (noisy labels) | v2 (corrected) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| MLP Top-1 accuracy | 45.1% | 84.9% | +88% relative |
| MLP Top-3 accuracy | 68.0% | 98.3% | +45% relative |
| Teacher coverage | 8.4% (6.5K domains) | 42.4% (32.9K domains) | 5.1x |
| Inter-annotator agreement (LLM-LLM) | 50.9% Kaggle-Opus | 81.7% Sonnet-Opus | +60% |

The v2 MLP (337K params, 1.3 MB) outperforms the v1 ModernBERT (150M params, 602 MB) by 23.6 percentage points. This is the empirical bound on how much model capacity can compensate for supervision noise in classification -- the answer is: almost nothing. A model with 443x fewer parameters trained on clean labels dominates a model trained on noisy labels, regardless of architecture depth or pre-training.

### Architectural Analysis

**Sparse projections preserve LLM-injected discriminative signal.** When the upstream feature generator (Sonnet) produces tokens conditioned on category membership, TF-IDF with sublinear TF (1 + log(tf)) and IDF weighting creates a feature space where category-indicative tokens receive near-orthogonal representation. The LinearSVC finds max-margin separating hyperplanes in this high-dimensional space with 99.9% sparsity -- a regime where kernel-free linear SVMs are theoretically optimal (the data is already linearly separable due to the LLM's implicit feature engineering).

**Dense sentence embeddings lose information through compression.** E5-small-v2 maps variable-length keyword sequences into a fixed 384-dimensional L2-normalized hypersphere. This projection optimizes for contrastive similarity (InfoNCE loss during pre-training) -- tokens with related semantics cluster together. But for classification, we need tokens to be discriminatively separated, not semantically clustered. The MLP (384->512->256->27, GELU activations, BatchNorm, Dropout 0.3) must then learn non-linear decision boundaries to re-separate what the encoder merged.

**The distillation loss landscape is well-behaved but information-bottlenecked.** Temperature-scaled KL divergence (T=2.0) from Opus soft labels provides rich gradient signal -- the teacher's probability mass over 27 categories encodes inter-class similarity structure (e.g., "Sports" and "Games" co-receive probability mass). But this signal cannot compensate for the upstream information loss in the embedding step. The alpha=0.7 weighting of KL vs BCE reflects that soft labels are more informative than hard labels, but both operate on the same compressed representation.

**Hyperparameter sensitivity confirms signal concentration.** Grid search over TF-IDF configurations (20K-50K features, unigrams through trigrams, various min_df thresholds) shows only 1.4pp total spread. The discriminative signal is concentrated in a small subset of high-IDF keyword tokens -- the feature space is overcomplete, and the SVM's L2 regularization handles the redundancy.

**Generalization metrics confirm no distributional shift.** Val/test gap of 0.1pp (91.6% vs 91.7%) indicates the Sonnet-generated keywords have consistent lexical distributions across splits -- expected since the same LLM generates all keywords with identical prompting.

### Per-Category Performance (TF-IDF + LinearSVC)

Strong performers (F1 > 0.95): Adult (0.963), Travel (0.962), Real Estate (0.958), Jobs & Education (0.955), News (0.954), Autos & Vehicles (0.953), Finance (0.950), Health (0.950)

Weak performers: Sensitive Subjects (0.000 -- only 3 val samples), Hobbies & Leisure (0.812), Online Communities (0.833), Science (0.854)

## Key Findings

1. **Annotation quality dominates model capacity by an order of magnitude.** A 337K-param MLP with LLM-corrected labels outperforms a 150M-param ModernBERT trained on crowd-sourced annotations by 23.6 percentage points (84.9% vs 61.3%). This is a 443x parameter disadvantage overcome purely by supervision quality -- confirming that for classification tasks, the Bayes error rate is set by label noise, not model expressiveness. The TF-IDF model achieves 91.6% with zero learned parameters beyond SVM support vectors.

2. **Crowd-sourced taxonomic annotations exhibit catastrophic error rates.** 49.7% of Kaggle labels are incorrect under LLM consensus (Sonnet-Opus inter-annotator agreement: 81.7% vs Kaggle-Opus: 50.9%). The error distribution is systematic, not random: Shopping was undercounted by 104% (e-commerce domains misclassified as Home & Garden, Business & Industrial), and Sensitive Subjects had 99% label error (annotator avoidance bias). This level of systematic noise cannot be overcome by regularization or robust loss functions -- it requires re-annotation.

3. **LLM-generated features create a representation regime where sparse methods are optimal.** When the feature generation step is itself a classification act (keyword extraction conditioned on category priors), the resulting text has near-maximal mutual information with labels. Sparse TF-IDF preserves per-token discriminative weight; dense encoders (E5-small, sentence-transformers) perform lossy compression optimized for semantic similarity, not classification separability. This inverts the standard feature learning hierarchy.

4. **Knowledge distillation from LLM soft labels provides diminishing returns when features are pre-discriminative.** The 5.1x increase in teacher coverage (6.5K to 32.9K Opus-labeled domains) combined with ground truth correction produced 88% relative improvement in the MLP. But the distilled MLP still trails TF-IDF by 6.7pp -- the information bottleneck is in the embedding step, not the supervision signal. Soft labels encode inter-class structure (category co-occurrence probabilities), but this structure is redundant when TF-IDF features already provide orthogonal class indicators.

5. **Inference latency spans 500x across architectures with diminishing accuracy returns.** TF-IDF: 0.02ms (sparse matrix multiply + SVM decision function). MLP: ~1ms (requires E5 forward pass for embedding generation). ModernBERT: ~10ms (full 150M-param forward pass). For RTB environments with 10ms total bid response budgets, only the sparse pipeline is viable without pre-computation or caching infrastructure.

cd bert-classification-iab

# Create environment and install dependencies
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
uv pip install anthropic httpx torch sentence-transformers pandas numpy pyarrow scikit-learn transformers

# Set up AWS config (required for LLM labeling scripts)
cp config.json.template config.json
# Edit config.json: replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS account ID

# Step 1: Run Sonnet data correction (async, ~4 hours, checkpoints every 200 domains)
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_sonnet_correction.py

# Step 2: Run Opus teacher labeling (async, ~4 hours, checkpoints every 200 domains)
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_teacher_labeling.py

# Step 3: Execute notebooks in order
.venv/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/v2-llm-corrected/03_embedding_generation.ipynb

.venv/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/v2-llm-corrected/06_tfidf_baseline.ipynb
```

Full pipeline takes approximately 5 hours (dominated by async LLM API calls). Model training alone takes under 2 minutes for TF-IDF and MLP combined.

### Configuration

The `config.json` file (not committed -- see `config.json.template`) contains:
- AWS Bedrock model ARNs for Opus and Sonnet
- Worker counts and checkpoint intervals
- AWS region

Scripts read all model IDs from this config file. You need AWS Bedrock access with Claude models enabled.

### Sample Data

`data/sample/corrected_sample.csv` contains 135 sample rows (5 per category) from the corrected training set, showing:
- `domain_clean`: the website domain
- `tier1`: the Sonnet-corrected category
- `tier1_kaggle`: the original (often wrong) Kaggle label
- `keywords`: Sonnet-generated English keywords
- `text`: enriched text used for classification (domain | title | keywords)

To run the full pipeline after cloning, generate the train embeddings first:
```bash
# Generate train embeddings (required for notebook 04 -- MLP distillation)
.venv/bin/jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute notebooks/v2-llm-corrected/03_embedding_generation.ipynb
```

Notebooks 01-02 (data correction, EDA) and 06 (TF-IDF) run directly on the included parquet files with no additional setup.

## Future Directions

| Approach | Architecture | Hypothesis |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **GTE-ModernBERT embeddings** | Matryoshka representation learning (768-dim, nested dimensionality) | Higher intrinsic dimensionality preserves more discriminative variance than E5's 384-dim bottleneck |
| **LoRA fine-tuning on small LLMs** | Rank-16 adaptation on Gemma-3-4B or Phi-4-mini with IAB-conditioned generation | Direct parameter-efficient fine-tuning bypasses the two-stage pipeline; the student IS the teacher |
| **Dual-encoder retrieval** | Contrastive pre-training of domain and category descriptions in shared embedding space | Enables zero-shot generalization to unseen IAB categories without re-training |
| **PECOS / extreme multi-label** | Hierarchical label tree with balanced k-means partitioning (XR-Transformer architecture) | Required for Tier-2 expansion (700+ categories) where flat softmax becomes computationally intractable |
| **Multimodal fusion** | Late fusion of URL text features + rendered page screenshot (ViT-B/16 encoder) | Captures visual brand signals and layout patterns invisible to text-only pipelines |
| **Online distillation with curriculum** | Anti-curriculum ordering (hard examples first) with dynamic temperature scheduling | May improve MLP convergence on tail categories where soft labels carry most information |
